Collaborated in developing a semantics called ‘reduct-\n        semantics’ for approximating an OWL ontology as an RDF graph. Using\n        reduct-semantics, forward reasoning can be done on OWL ontologies as the\n        deductive closure is guaranteed to be finite. The system was implemented\n        and tested on industry strength RDF and OWL ontologies.\n      </section>\n      <hr />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Project;\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AAEA,OAAOC,WAAP,MAAwB,8BAAxB;AACA,OAAOC,GAAP,MAAgB,mBAAhB;AAEA,OAAO,oBAAP;;;AAEA,SAASC,OAAT,CAAiBC,KAAjB,EAAwB;EACtB,oBACE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,SAAf;IAAA,wBACE;MAAA,wBACE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QADF,eAEE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAFF,EAEyB,GAFzB,eAGE;QAAG,IAAI,EAAC,qBAAR;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAHF,eAIE;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAJF,eAKE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QALF,oIAQE;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QARF,eASE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QATF,y6BAuBE;QACE,GAAG,EAAC,2CADN;QAEE,KAAK,EAAC,sBAFR;QAGE,WAAW,EAAC,GAHd;QAIE,KAAK,EAAC,0FAJR;QAKE,eAAe;MALjB;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAvBF;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QADF,eAgCE;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAhCF,eAiCE;MAAA,wBACE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QADF,eAEE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAFF,EAEyB,GAFzB,eAGE;QAAG,IAAI,EAAC,2CAAR;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAHF,eAME;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QANF,eAOE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAPF,gJAUE;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAVF,eAWE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAXF,osCA8BE;QAAK,GAAG,EAAEH,WAAV;QAAuB,GAAG,EAAC;MAA3B;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QA9BF;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAjCF,eAiEE;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAjEF,eAkEE;MAAA,wBACE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QADF,eAEE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAFF,EAEyB,GAFzB,eAGE;QAAG,IAAI,EAAC,wBAAR;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAHF,eAIE;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAJF,eAKE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QALF,sQASE;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QATF,eAUE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAVF,+rEA0CiD;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QA1CjD,eA2CE;QAAK,GAAG,EAAEC,GAAV;QAAe,GAAG,EAAC;MAAnB;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QA3CF;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAlEF,eA+GE;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QA/GF,eAgHE;MAAA,wBACE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QADF,eAEE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAFF,EAEyB,GAFzB,eAGE;QAAG,IAAI,EAAC,4BAAR;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAHF,eAIE;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAJF,eAKE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QALF,4FAOE;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAPF,eAQE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QARF;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAhHF,eAmIE;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAnIF;EAAA;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QADF;AAuID;;KAxIQC,O;AA0IT,eAAeA,OAAf"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
